# React Projects



## Things to remember from docs:
- React components are JavaScript functions that return markup.
- React component names must always start with a capital letter.
- The <code>export default</code> keywords specify the main component in the file.
- CRA is dead, move to vite+js or vite+ts


# Get Away from Class Based Components.
- Lean towards Functional components.
