# Modern React Development <br>
In this repository, I'll be implementing several UI layouts and SPA's to create a few portfolio projects.<br>
More Coming Soon!


## Things to remember from docs:
- React components are JavaScript functions that return markup.
- React component names must always start with a capital letter.
- The <code> export default </code>keywords specify the main component in the file.
- In React, you specify a CSS class with <code> className </code>. It works the same way as the HTML class attribute.
